**1. Set Clear Goals:** Know what you want to achieve in each study session. Having a clear goal will help you stay focused.

**2. Organize Your Space:** Create a clean and comfortable study environment. Remove distractions like your phone or TV.

**3. Use a Planner:** Write down important dates and deadlines in a planner or on your phone. This helps you stay organized.

**4. Break it Down:** Divide your study material into smaller, manageable chunks. It's easier to tackle smaller bits at a time.

**5. Active Learning:** Instead of passively reading, engage with the material. Take notes, ask questions, and discuss topics with classmates.

**6. Practice Regularly:** After studying a topic, take practice sets or quizzes. Testing yourself reinforces your knowledge.

**7. Teach Someone:** Teaching someone else what you've learned is a great way to solidify your understanding.

*One of my favourite ways to enhance my understanding of a subject is by teaching it to someone else. Sharing your knowledge is not only a great way to reinforce your own concepts but also to maximize your learning benefits. Give it a try and experience the profound impact it can have on your understanding.*

**8. Healthy Lifestyle:** Get enough sleep, eat well, and exercise. A healthy body supports a healthy mind.

**9. Take Breaks:** Breaks are essential to recharge your brain. Try the Pomodoro technique â€“ study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.

**10. Seek Help When Needed:** Don't be afraid to ask for help from professors, tutors, or classmates if you're struggling with a topic. They're there to assist you.

Hope this helps you in your studying!
