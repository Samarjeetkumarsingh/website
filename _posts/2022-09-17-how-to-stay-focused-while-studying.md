Instead of dreading that you’ll have to force urself to sit at ur desk for hours, use a timer. That way you allow ur brain to focus in a more targeted and effective way. 

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬:

𝐆𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐲 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥: Set the timer to 50-minute increments to maximize concentration, followed by a 10-minute break. For really short bursts of study, try the Pomodoro technique which consists of 25 minute blocks of time, followed by 5 minute breaks. Write ✍️ important things down in a note book 📖 and use it as short notes 📝 for the revision.

𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Use the review questions from ur textbook or bookmark questions of the test series. Then, take mock tests to rehearse for the exam. Give urself only a short time to answer each question.

𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐬: When you're done with one timed segment, do something that has nothing to do with ur study 📚: get some fresh air, stretch, walk around, have a snack, grab a cup of coffee or tea.

Happy Preparation!
