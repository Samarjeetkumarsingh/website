**Dear Learners,**.

As a learner, I have figured out some pretty useful hacks regarding studying:

❶ 𝐏𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲: Place it in somewhere like a safe, or have someone you trust (i.e., roommate, parent) hide it from you. Make sure it’s turned off, or at least on silent mode.

❷ 𝐇𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮, 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: If you get up to grab something that you need, there’s a 99% chance you will get distracted by something else. Make sure all materials are right by you such as books/E-books, pens, copies, water bottle, etc.

❸ 𝐏𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐚 𝐬𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: If you are anything like me, it will be a quiet, but not so silent place, with TVs and radios off, and no food in sight to serve as distractions. Some people study better in loud, bustling environments, and others in silent, bare rooms…. It's totally up to you!!!

❹ 𝐃𝐎 𝐍𝐎𝐓, 𝐃𝐎 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐘 𝐎𝐍 𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆: Reading notes over and over is a waste of time. Do something. Make tests for urself, make flashcards/short notes, explain the topics to urself in a mirror (or someone else) etc.

𝐊𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠!!
