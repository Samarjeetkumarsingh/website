title: What is it like working at Kartavya (NGO)? 
---

First of all I would like to share, why I became part of  KARTAVYA, RANCHI CHAPTER.

"I become emotional when I see children on footpaths, near stations begging for food, money, etc. Sometimes I cried to see them so and thought I could help all of them. There might be hidden Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam or another great engineer, doctor, teacher, etc in one of them. I think education is the only way to solve all the problems which we are facing in the society today.

Before #KARTAVYA RANCHI CHAPTER, I used to teach as well but that was only Maths & Chemistry to 10+2 students during difficult times. And now, at KARTAVYA I have learnt that teaching A, B, C, D or multiplication tables or Hindi is much more difficult than teaching 'Maths, Phy & Chem to 10+2 students'. But I can also say that one can't get more job satisfaction by teaching anywhere other than at this job: smiles and those 'good morning bhaiya' greetings even in the evenings (that I am sure my fellow KARTAVYA volunteers can relate to).

We all have grown in such families that are at least able to help reach to this level and, in combination of our efforts, with the aid of the guidance from the parents, teachers and the helpful environment (that is, the aiding mentality of the society) that is behind us, I feel that it is now our responsibility, not as as students of NIFFT or any other institution but as citizens of India, to give these children a chance to move forward as well. And Its a responsibility to give strength to their dreams and courage to fly...!!! Its just an attempt to hold their hands and show them the way... to just make them realise their potential to soar high ... to just make them believe we care for them and that we are here for them. Thatâ€™s why I joined KARTAVYA and headed it almost 2 years.

They changed my life and the duration for which I stayed there with those kids where the best days of life. And I hope, I will continue help them to succeed their life.!!

Here are some great moments of my life.
