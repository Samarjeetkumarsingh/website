title: Why am I still single?? 
---

**Let's us redefine relationships and chemistry**.

**Covalent bonds**- Bonding after marriage.

**Ionic bonds** - just after someone starts dating.

**Vanderwall bonds**-just started seeing each other or one sided.

**Legends(Extrovert)** -they are able to break even covalent bonds.

**Studs(Ambivert)** -they are able to break ionic bonds.

**Me/My friends(Introvert)ðŸ˜€** -Not able to break even vanderwall bonds(hahaha).

Cheers!!
