Dear aspirants,

Short notes are very essential for any exam. Short notes helped me a lot in last days of my examination. 

**Short notes 📝 help in following ways:**

✅While making short notes, you are reading Ur class notes/books/study-materials thoroughly, and then you pick up the most important concepts, formulas and graphs and write ✍️ them down.

✅ Making short notes 📝 will make sure that you never forget those important concepts because those are the first thing we see when we have less time to revise for exams. 

✅ Making short notes helps a lot during revision sessions because you can’t go through the entire study materials 📚 or books📕. You can read Ur short notes and then directly go for problem solving.

✅ Write down all formulas, important concepts and include important graphs 📈 while making short notes. There are many books 📚 in the market but Ur personalised short notes are always better.

The real importance of short notes is realised one day before the exam. You want to revise, but you don’t have time to go through Ur entire notes. Do make short notes if you don’t want to regret later.

Happy Learning!!!
