**Pursued Metallurgy and Materials Engineering despite not being aware of the branch and subsequently Masters from one of the prestigious college of our country, IISc Bangalore.**

In a recent post, Elon Musk shared a valuable suggestion on two courses that any student wanting to learn something new could take. 

**The two courses which he suggests are **

1. Materials Science
2. Astronomy 

**What is Materials Science ðŸ§ª?**

Materials Science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific study which covers properties, applications, design and discovery of new materials. These materials include metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite. In incorporates elements of physics, chemistry and engineering.

**What is Astronomy ðŸ”­?**

Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe thatâ€™s beyond our own planetâ€™s atmosphere. The planets in our own solar system, our own star the sun, and the bright stars can all be seen with the naked eye. However, astronomy can go much deeper, taking advantage of telescopes and other scientific instruments to study other stars and their planets in our galaxy, as well as distant galaxies beyond our own.

If you are going to take any branch kindly make sure that you have knowledge about it.

Happy learning!
