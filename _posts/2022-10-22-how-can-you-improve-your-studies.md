Studying can be hard. But anybody can develop good study habits to make studying more effective, efficient, and enjoyable.

**Want to develop good study habits?** 

Start small—don’t expect to do everything in this list, at least not right away; pick one or two instead. It’s also important to set realistic and achievable goals for yourself. 

**Good study habits to develop:**

**Here are tips to improve your study habits:**

1. Find a productive place to study.
2. Minimize distractions.
3. Take breaks.
4. Don't study to just pass the exam
5. Set study goals for each session.
6. Study with a group.
7. TestUrSelf.
8. Make short notes.
9. Ask for help.
10. Use your own words
11. Take care of yourself.
12. Hydrate yourself
13. Know your purpose for studying 

***Let's take a closer look at how you can implement each of these habits.***

**1. Find a productive place to study.**

Finding a good location to study is one of the most important elements of studying well. Look for a quiet place with minimal distractions—someplace where you’ll be able to focus

A college or public library, a coffee shop, or a quiet corner of your house can all be good places to start. 

**2. Minimize distractions.**

Selecting a good location to study can be the first step in keeping yourself focused on your work.

Turning off your notifications, keeping your phone out of sight in your bag, or giving it to a friend to keep you from checking it too often can help you stay focused.
Study with a friend: Sometimes studying with a friend or two, whether or not you’re working on the same material, can help keep you accountable and focused.

**3. Take breaks.**

Taking intentional breaks has been linked to better retention, increased attention, and boosts in energy.

You can do things as

- Take a short walk
- Listen to a mood-boosting song
- Relax with a friend
- Stretch
- Have a snack
- Clean your desk or room

**4. Don't study to just pass the exam.**

Instead of saving your studying for before a test, briefly review material you learned once a week. If you are studying for an exam, Make sure that you are studying for up to several weeks (or even months, depending on the test) leading up to the exam day. This can help you retain the information long term. 

**5. Set study goals for each session.**

Set study goals for each session of studying you have. These can be time-based or content-based. For example, you might aim to study for two hours, or review three chapters of your textbook—or both.

Don’t be too harsh on yourself if you didn’t get through as much as you had planned; sometimes studying can take longer than expected. Keep taking well-spaced breaks, and schedule another study session.

**6. Study with a group.**

There are several benefits to forming a study group. Group members can help one another work through difficult problems, provide encouragement, hold each other accountable to studying goals, provide different perspectives, and make studying more enjoyable. Even explaining difficult concepts to others can help with comprehension and retention. 

If you have a group study session, set a goal the group will work towards and take periodic breaks as you would studying by yourself.

**7. TestUrSelf.**

Tests and practice tests have been long seen as useful tools to help students learn and retain information. Besides checking your prep level and reducing exam anxiety, being tested makes us retrieve information from memory—a powerful, study-backed way of holding the information that we have learned.

**8. Make Short Notes.**

Our brain memories short points more easily than huge paragraphs, make your notes accordingly.

**9. Ask for Help.**

There are people who can help you learn better, be humble, and ask for help.

**10. Use your own words.**

Expressing an idea in your own words increases your understanding of a subject and helps your brain hang on to information. After you read a section of text, summarize important points by paraphrasing. 

**11. Take care of yourself.**

At the end of the day, your brain is an organ in your body—take care of it by taking care of yourself. Get regular exercise, eat well, don’t overdrink, get good sleep, and take care of your mental wellbeing. 

**12. Hydrate yourself.**

Staying hydrated can improve mental performance and concentration.

**13. Know your purpose for studying.**

Why are you studying? Why do you want good marks/ranks? Know your motivations to have motivation.

Hope this helps you:)
