**Benefits of Notes taking 📝?**

Note taking provides several benefits beyond that record of what was taught in a lecture or class.

**Here are some benefits of Notes taking 📝!**

📄**Keep you alert:** Note taking keeps our body active and involved and helps us to avoid distraction.

📄**Engages our mind:** Listening carefully and deciding what to include in notes keeps our mind activity involved with what we hear.

📄**Emphasises & organises information:** As we take notes, we’ll decide on and highlight the key ideas we hear, identifying the structure of a class lecture. We will also be able to highlight the important points, making study and understanding easier after class. Such organised notes make it easier for us to link classroom learning to textbook 📕 readings.

📄**Creates a condensed record for study**: A set of concise, well organised notes 📝 from each class session gives us what we need for study 📚, learning, and revision after class.

Happy Learning!
