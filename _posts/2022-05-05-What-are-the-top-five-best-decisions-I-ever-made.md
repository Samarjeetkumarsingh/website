title: What are the top five decisions I ever made?? 
---

**These are my 5 best decisions which I have taken till now.**


1. Decided to leave IIIT-Allahabad in between because I was not good in programming at all even though I was not aware about my aim at that time.

2. Took Metallurgy and Materials Engineering in B.Tech even though I was not aware about it before and Today I am pursuing my Masters degree in Materials Engineering from one of the prestigious college of our country, IISC Bangalore .

3. Decided to write books because of wanted to dedicate this to my beloved father despites that my English is so terrible and today I have published my very first book on GATE for Metallurgical Engineering and it's going good. You can check it, the link is here,https://notionpress.com/author/sujit_samarjeet.

4. Decided to start my own venture which can provide quality contents for GATE aspirants for streams and see our students are secruing **AIR-1** since GATE 2019. You can go through it, [Click Here](https://www.testurself.in).
