title: How should I prepare for the GATE Metallurgy?? 
---
Dear aspirants,

I am going to give answer into different parts:

**Part 1: Syllabus:**

1. Download the GATE syllabus and pin it on Your Study room’s wall. You can download it here by clicking on “Metallurgical Engineering “[Click Here]([https://online.testurself.in](https://www.testurself.in/what-is-gate/)).
2. GATE is an exam exam where syllabus is quite vast. Almost 4 years of syllabus is asked in a single 3- hour exam. The syllabus-to-exam time is highest in GATE, the syllabus is distributed across many tests.

This is how a section of syllabus is going to look like:

1. Now, as you would have noticed, there is a big problem here. The official syllabus only mentions broad topics which include many other small subtopics within themselves. For example, in the topic “Solutions”, there are a LOT of topics and concepts involved, about which there is no mention in official syllabus.
2. And if you are not specifically aware of what to read, what not to read and how much to read, you will get diverted towards wrong direction which will not benefit you in GATE Exam. So, for new aspirants, knowing what to read, what not to read and how much to read is also struggle.
3. So break the syllabus into small part like if you see syllabus of thermodynamics then you will find there are included many small topics like basic of thermodynamics, Corrosion, Heat and mass transfers, Fluid mechanics etc. so you will have to break it into small portion.

**Part 2: Books:**

1. Select any one topic from that and then start studying it from the standards books only. You can find here list of standard books [Click Here](https://www.testurself.in/reference-books/metallurgical-engineering/).

**Part 3: Notes:**

1. While studying make a Short notes and as well as Numerical Learning notes so you can follow it anytime without wasting so much time on books. You can find the importance of short/long notes below:

**Short Notes:** This include formulae plus 1-2 liner concepts which cover the whole relevant GATE syllabus in shortest time possible. Try to write very common and obvious concepts as short as you can. No need to write full sentences. You can use symbols, diagrams, fl ow-charts, arrows etc. to make it short and crisp. To give you an idea, you have to make so concise that you revise 1 subject in just 2-3 hours.

**Numerical Learning Notes:** When you face any good questions that you solve from TestUrSelf Practice Sets (we have introduced **Practice Questions Series (PQS)** in TestUrSelf platform), quiz, online assignments, or test series, and you observe something conceptually new in that question, note that question down.

2. Also note what is good thing you found in that question. Keep revising these notes once a week, preferably on Saturdays/Sundays.
3. *This way you will never forget the learning from these questions and Ur numerical solving capability will also improve gradually, which is very important for GATE Exam.

**Part 4: Test Series:**

**Join TEST SERIES:** Test series is a very useful tool to crack GATE Exam. They are used to

1. *Compare Ur performance with other aspirants.
2. *Check Ur improvement relative to other aspirants.
3. *Build exam taking skills.
4. *Making plan for writing GATE Exam that which section are you going to attempting first, etc.

***Other than solving good questions, analysing Ur performance is equally important when GATE Exam approaches near. If you don’t understand and do not correct what you are doing wrong, how you think you can improve? And that is why many aspirants keep on attending more and more tests but not see any major improvement.

**Analysing Ur test can be broken down into many factors:

1. Identifying particular mistaken pattern.
2. Recognising types of mistakes you do.
3. Finding Ur weak / strong theory subjects.
4. Finding Ur weak / strong numerical subjects.
5. Inventing test writing strategies.
........and many more.

- You should do a thorough analysis of all this after attending any test (specially full length tests).
- And based upon that analysis, you should keep improving the way you have been attempting tests.

***Some important things to keep in mind regarding test series:

1. Attempt Sectionwise / Partial tests from the beginning and start attempting Full Length tests 2 months before GATE Exam.
2. Try to attempt at least 10 Full Length tests.
3. Never join a Test Series which has irrelevant questions. It will do more harm than good.
4. If you have already join any such test series, stop writing tests from that if you want to really improve and reach Ur maximum.
5. Keep adding good conceptual question to the Numerical Learning notes.
6. Do not judge Ur capabilities from the marks you get. Keep working to improve them. We already gave you the example of AIR -1 in GATE 20222, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
7. Test series is all about learning and improving. Getting good rank in mock test is not Ur motive. You motive to get good marks in GATE Exam.

***I am very proud to say that TestUrSelf is the ONLY Test Series for GATE which provides not only GATE relevant questions but also very advanced performance analysis. You can search on internet about the reviews.


Happy Preparations!!
