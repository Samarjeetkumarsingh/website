**How the Pomodoro Technique Works?**

**Step 1: Define Your Goal**

Start by figuring out what you want to achieve. Whether it's studying, work, or a project, identify the task at hand.

**Step 2: Divide into Pomodoros**

Break your work into smaller chunks, known as "pomodoros." Estimate how many pomodoros you'll need to complete your task.

**Step 3: Set a Timer for 25 Minutes**

Use a timer, like a Pomodoro app on your phone or an online timer. Set it for 25 minutes – this is your focused work time.

**Step 4: Engage with Your Task**

During the 25-minute pomodoro, fully immerse yourself in the task. Minimize distractions and jot down any stray thoughts.

**Step 5: Take a Short Break**

Once the timer rings, take a 5-10 minute break. Use this time to relax – grab a drink, stretch, or do something enjoyable.

**Step 6: Repeat and Review**

Begin another 25-minute pomodoro. After completing four pomodoros, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes to recharge.

**➡ Bonus Tip: Early Completion**

If you finish your task within a pomodoro, use the extra time for a quick review or prep for the next session.

**Why the Pomodoro Technique Works?**

📍 Focused Engagement
By dedicating 25 minutes solely to your task, you enhance your engagement and learning.

📍 Strategic Breaks
Short breaks after each pomodoro prevent burnout, while longer breaks enable your brain to consolidate what you've learned.

📍 Enhanced Concentration
As you practice, your attention span and focus improve, making you more productive.
