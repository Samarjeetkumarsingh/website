title: What was your study schedule? 
---

**Dear students,**

When I was preparing for competitive exams like **JEE and GATE**, I had a structured approach to my studies. I used to create a study routine that included specific blocks of time for studying, breaks, and other activities. I would also set my goals for the next day before going to bed, and make a schedule that included the specific tasks or concepts I needed to study and the time I needed to dedicate to each. I prioritized my tasks and made sure to be realistic about the amount of time I could dedicate to studying. I also allowed for flexibility in my routine and took regular breaks to improve my focus and reduce fatigue. Additionally, I used to write down my observations about my study sessions, including what worked well and what I struggled with before going to bed and regularly analyze them. This helped me to identify patterns and areas for improvement, and improve my study duration and performance. I used to make study routine like this one.

|**Study Slot**| **Timing** | **Subjects & Tasks** | **Remarks** |$\hline$
| ---------|------| ---------------|-------|
| **Slot-I** | 8.00 AM-12.00 PM     | Topic-1, Topic-2 & Solving Problems | - |
| **Slot-II**| 2.00 PM-05.00 PM      | Topic-3, Topic-4 & Revisions | -|
| **Slot-III**| 7.00 PM-10.00 PM    | Topic-5, Topic-6, Solving Problems & Making Schedule | -|


*One way to enhance your study routine is to take a few minutes before going to bed to reflect on your performance throughout the day. You can do this by keeping a "remark section" where you can write down your observations about your study sessions, including what worked well and what you struggled with. By regularly analyzing these remarks, you can identify patterns and areas for improvement.*

**An effective study routine is essential for achieving success in your studies. One way to create an efficient routine is to plan it out the night before. Here are some steps you can take to create an authentic routine:**
1. **Set your goals for the next day:** Before going to bed, take a few minutes to think about what you want to accomplish the next day. Identify the specific tasks or concepts you need to study and the time you need to dedicate to each.
2. **Make a schedule:** Once you have identified your goals, create a schedule that includes specific blocks of time for studying, breaks, and other activities.
3. **Prioritize your tasks:** Determine which tasks are most important and should be completed first. It may be helpful to start with the most challenging or time-consuming tasks when you have the most energy.
1. **Be realistic:** When planning your schedule, make sure to be realistic about the amount of time you can realistically dedicate to studying. Avoid overloading your schedule with too many tasks.
2. **Allow for flexibility:** Remember that unexpected events can come up, so be prepared to adjust your schedule if necessary.
3. **Stick to your routine:** Once you have created your schedule, make sure to stick to it as closely as possible. This will help you to develop good study habits and make the most of your time.
4. **Take breaks:** It's essential to take regular breaks during your study routine. It's scientifically proven that taking short breaks improves focus, reduces fatigue and increases productivity.

By following these steps, you can create an authentic routine that will help you to make the most of your study time. Remember to be consistent and adaptable, and you will be well on your way to success.

**I wish you all the best for your upcoming exams, may you have a great success.**
