The idea and implementation of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} is the brainchild of Samarjeet Kumar Singh. A person who secured AIR-7 from Metallurgical Engineering in GATE 2016 in his first attempt. He comes from a very humble background where getting education is dream for thousands. He cleared IIT-JEE with very limited resources. <br> However, due to not getting any good streams, he opted for IIIT-Allahabad. 

The destiny has something else in his mind. Due to some personal issues and limited resources, he had to leave the IIIT-A in between. Later, he completed B.Tech in Metallurgical Engineering. He decided to write a book dedicated to Metallurgical engineering, which proved to be a turning point in his life. He got this book published while doing his Masters from IISc Bangalore. After this, he started TestUrSelf in 2017 from a tiny little room. He single handedly made all the study materials, test papers and solutions, a herculean task in itself. This shows his sheer grit and dedication.
