**"I document my experiences and insights on topics such as the education system, examination strategies, mathematics, materials engineering, and the process of learning through my personal journey."**. 

The idea and implementation of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} is the brainchild of me. I secured **AIR-7** from Metallurgical Engineering in GATE 2016 in my first attempt. I come from a very humble background where getting education is dream for thousands. I cleared **IIT-JEE** with very limited resources. <br> However, due to not getting any good streams, I opted for **IIIT-Allahabad**. 

The destiny has something else in my mind. Due to some personal issues and limited resources, I had to leave the IIIT-A in between. Later, I completed B.Tech in Materials Engineering. I decided to write a book dedicated to Metallurgical engineering, which proved to be a turning point in my life. I got this book published while doing my Masters from IISc Bangalore. After this, I started [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} in 2017 from a tiny little room. Now my students are securing AIR-1 in GATE exam since 2019.
