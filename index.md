**"I document my experiences and insights on topics such as the education system, examination strategies, mathematics, materials engineering, and the process of learning through my personal journey."** 

I am the creator of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"}, an innovative platform that provides educational resources for students. My passion for education and commitment to helping others led me to develop this platform. I have a strong background in education, having achieved the top rank of **AIR-7** in Metallurgical Engineering in **GATE 2016** in my first attempt. Although I came from humble beginnings and had limited resources, I managed to excel in the IIT-JEE (Advanced) and AIEEE (IIT-Mains) exams and was able to enroll in **IIIT-Allahabad** because I did not secure a desirable branch at an **IIT**, where I further honed my skills and knowledge. Driven by my personal experiences and a desire to help others, I created [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} to provide students with the tools and resources they need to succeed in their education.


My life's journey took an unexpected turn when personal issues and limited resources forced me to leave **IIIT-Allahabad** during my studies. Despite this setback, I persevered and completed my B.Tech in Materials Engineering. This experience inspired me to write a book dedicated to the field of **Metallurgical Engineering**, which proved to be a turning point in my life. I was able to get my book published while pursuing my Masters from IISc Bangalore. This accomplishment gave me the confidence and motivation to start [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} in 2017, which I did from a small room. Today, my students have been securing top ranks in GATE exams, including **AIR-1**, since 2019. I am proud to have been able to contribute to their success and help them achieve their academic goals.

Building on the success of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"}, I created another platform, [**TestUrExam**](https://testurexam.in){:target="_blank"}, which provides mock tests for a wide range of exams. This platform is designed to help students prepare for their exams and achieve their academic goals. With TestUrExam, students have access to a wealth of resources and mock tests that are tailored to their specific exam needs. I am dedicated to helping students succeed, and [**TestUrExam**](https://testurexam.in){:target="_blank"} is just one more way that I am able to do so.

I am honored to announce that I have taken on the role of one of the Directors of **[Kartavya](https://instagram.com/kartavya_niamt?igshid=Zjc2ZTc4Nzk=){:target="_blank"}, Ranchi**. At Kartavya, we firmly believe that education can combat poverty and improve people's lives. **[Kartavya](https://instagram.com/kartavya_niamt?igshid=Zjc2ZTc4Nzk=){:target="_blank"}** is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing a comprehensive education to underprivileged students. Our mission is to provide a learning platform for students who lack access to quality education and to help them grow both academically and socially.
