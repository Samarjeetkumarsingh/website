**"I document my experiences and insights on topics such as the education system, examination strategies, mathematics, materials engineering, and the process of learning through my personal journey."**. 

The idea and implementation of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} is the brainchild of me. I secured **AIR-7** from Metallurgical Engineering in GATE 2016 in my first attempt. I come from a very humble background where getting education is dream for thousands. I cleared **IIT-JEE** with very limited resources. <br> However, due to not getting any good streams, I opted for **IIIT-Allahabad**. 

I am the creator of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"}, an innovative platform that provides educational resources for students. My passion for education and commitment to helping others led me to develop this platform. I have a strong background in education, having achieved the top rank of **AIR-7** in Metallurgical Engineering in **GATE 2016** in my first attempt, despite my humble beginnings and limited resources. I successfully cleared **IIT-JEE** and enrolled in IIIT-Allahabad, where I further honed my skills and knowledge. Driven by my personal experiences and a desire to help others, I created TestUrSelf to provide students with the tools and resources they need to succeed in their education.


My life's journey took an unexpected turn when personal issues and limited resources forced me to leave IIIT-Allahabad during my studies. Despite this setback, I persevered and completed my B.Tech in Materials Engineering. This experience inspired me to write a book dedicated to the field of Metallurgical Engineering, which proved to be a turning point in my life. I was able to get my book published while pursuing my Masters from IISc Bangalore. This accomplishment gave me the confidence and motivation to start[**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} in 2017, which I did from a small room. Today, my students have been securing top ranks in GATE exams, including **AIR-1**, since 2019. I am proud to have been able to contribute to their success and help them achieve their academic goals.
