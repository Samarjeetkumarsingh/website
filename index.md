**I'm a materials engineer who loves memes and learning. I document my experiences and insights on topics such as the education system, examination strategies, mathematics, and the process of learning through my personal journey.** 

Welcome to my personal website! I'm the founder of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"}, an online platform dedicated to helping students prepare for the GATE exam. My journey has been one of resilience and determination, stemming from a humble background. Despite limited resources, I successfully cleared the IIT-JEE and achieved an impressive **All India Rank of 7** in Metallurgical Engineering in the GATE 2016 exam.

Although I faced personal challenges that led me to leave IIIT-Allahabad, I persevered and completed my B.Tech in Metallurgical Engineering. During my studies, I authored a book on the subject, which was later published while I pursued my Masters at IISc Bangalore.

In 2017, fueled by my passion for education and driven by the desire to empower students, I founded [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} from a small room. Since then, it has grown into a comprehensive platform trusted by many aspirants for their exam preparation needs. Join me on this journey of learning and achievement as we strive towards excellence together.

Since 2019, our students have consistently clinched top ranks in GATE exams, including the prestigious **AIR-1.** It fills me with immense pride to have played a part in their journey, supporting them in reaching their academic aspirations and achieving remarkable success.

I am honored to announce that I have taken on the role of one of the Directors of **[Mission Kartavya Foundation](https://www.instagram.com/kartavya_niamt?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==){:target="_blank"}, Ranchi**. At Kartavya, we firmly believe that education can combat poverty and improve people's lives. **[Mission Kartavya Foundation](https://https://www.instagram.com/kartavya_niamt?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==){:target="_blank"}** is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing a comprehensive education to underprivileged students. Our mission is to provide a learning platform for students who lack access to quality education and to help them grow both academically and socially.

**[Mission Kartavya Foundation](https://www.instagram.com/kartavya_niamt?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==){:target="_blank"}** was established at NIAMT (formerly NIFFT) to address the need for educational support in the Hatia community.
