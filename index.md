**I'm a materials engineer who loves memes and learning. I document my experiences and insights on topics such as the education system, examination strategies, mathematics, and the process of learning through my personal journey.** 

Welcome to my personal website! I'm the founder of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"}, an online platform dedicated to helping students prepare for the GATE exam. My journey has been one of resilience and determination, stemming from a humble background. Despite limited resources, I successfully cleared the IIT-JEE and achieved an impressive All India Rank of 7 in Metallurgical Engineering in the GATE exam.

Although I faced personal challenges that led me to leave IIIT-Allahabad, I persevered and completed my B.Tech in Metallurgical Engineering. During my studies, I authored a book on the subject, which was later published while I pursued my Masters at IISc Bangalore.

In 2017, fueled by my passion for education and driven by the desire to empower students, I founded [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} from a small room. Since then, it has grown into a comprehensive platform trusted by many aspirants for their exam preparation needs. Join me on this journey of learning and achievement as we strive towards excellence together.

I am the creator of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"}, an innovative platform that provides educational resources for students. My passion for education and commitment to helping others led me to develop this platform. I have a strong background in education, having achieved the top rank of **AIR-7** in Metallurgical Engineering in **GATE 2016** in my first attempt. Although I came from humble beginnings and had limited resources, I managed to excel in the IIT-JEE (Advanced) and AIEEE (IIT-Mains) exams and was able to enroll in **IIIT-Allahabad** because I did not secure a desirable branch at an **IIT**, where I further honed my skills and knowledge. Driven by my personal experiences and a desire to help others, I created [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} to provide students with the tools and resources they need to succeed in their education.

Since 2019, our students have consistently clinched top ranks in GATE exams, including the prestigious AIR-1. It fills me with immense pride to have played a part in their journey, supporting them in reaching their academic aspirations and achieving remarkable success.

I am honored to announce that I have taken on the role of one of the Directors of **[Mission Kartavya Foundation](https://www.missionkartavya.org){:target="_blank"}, Ranchi**. At Kartavya, we firmly believe that education can combat poverty and improve people's lives. **[Mission Kartavya Foundation](https://www.missionkartavya.org){:target="_blank"}** is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing a comprehensive education to underprivileged students. Our mission is to provide a learning platform for students who lack access to quality education and to help them grow both academically and socially.

**[Mission Kartavya Foundation](https://www.missionkartavya.org){:target="_blank"}** was established at NIAMT (formerly NIFFT) to address the need for educational support in the Hatia community.
