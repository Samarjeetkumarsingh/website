The idea and implementation of [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} is the brainchild of me. I secured AIR-7 from Metallurgical Engineering in GATE 2016 in my first attempt. I come from a very humble background where getting education is dream for thousands. I cleared IIT-JEE with very limited resources. <br> However, due to not getting any good streams, he opted for IIIT-Allahabad. 

The destiny has something else in my mind. Due to some personal issues and limited resources, I had to leave the IIIT-A in between. Later, I completed B.Tech in Metallurgical Engineering. I decided to write a book dedicated to Metallurgical engineering, which proved to be a turning point in my life. I got this book published while doing my Masters from IISc Bangalore. After this, I started [**TestUrSelf**](https://www.testurself.in){:target="_blank"} in 2017 from a tiny little room. I single handedly made all the study materials, test papers and solutions, a herculean task in itself.
